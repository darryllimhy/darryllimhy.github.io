            I used w3schools as a resource to learn how to use the basics of HTML & CSS like the syntax for the nav,img and a elements for HTML. For CSS, I learnt how to edit the different properties of certain html elements like font-size and font-color, and background-color.
            <br>
            For the basics of HTML, the code wrapped in triangle brackets are called elements. The 'p' element declares a new paragraph where you can type text in. The elements beginning with 'h' such as 'h1', 'h2', 'h3' are header elements where the text between those elements will be bolded and scaled up to a certain size. For the 'nav','ul','li' elements they are elements that make up a list in a navigation system.

                <img src="images/meGIMP.png" width=300px><br>
                I used the free transform tool in GIMP to trace the silhouette of me ,deleted the background of the original picture and inserted a background of a beach.<br>

                <h2>Inkscape</h2>
                <img src="images/shisa.jpg" width=300px><br>
                I opened the image using Inkscape and used the path tool to trace the outlines of the creature.
                <img src="images/inkscapeoutline.png" width=300px>
                <img src="images/inkscape.png" width=300px><br>
                After tracing, I used the fill tool to fill in the basic colours of the creature.

                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/Tag2.png" width=600px><br>
                After making the sketch (Create > Create Sketch), I used extrude (Create > Extrude) on the silhouette, the base of the name tag and on the text of my name.

                <h2>Lego</h2>
                <h3>Overhead View</h3>
                <img src="images/Lego1.png" width=600px><br>
                I sketched a rectanglular shape and used extrude to form a cuboid. I then sketched a circle on the surface of the top side of the cuboid, extruded it, used fillet (Modify > Fillet) to round out the edges and then used rectangular pattern (Create > Pattern > Rectangular Pattern) to repeat the modified circle.
                <h3>Bottom View</h3>
                <img src="images/Lego2.png" width=600px><br>
                I hollowed out the bottom of the cuboid with shell (Modify > Shell), sketched out two circles and extruded them to form a cylinder. After which, I also used the rectangular pattern to repeat the cylinders.

                <h2>Chess Piece - Knight</h2>
                <h3>Sketch</h3>
                <img src="images/Knight2.png" width=600px><br>
                I inserted a reference image found online using canvas (Insert > Canvas) and traced it, only making slight adjustments to the base of the chess piece. After tracing it, I was not satisfied with the size of the chess piece so I scaled (Modify > Scale) the outlines to my liking.
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/Knight1.png" width=600px><br>
                I used revolve on the base and extruded the body of the chess piece. I wanted to add more details to the body of the Knight so I made more sketches and used extrude. I extruded the mane of the Knight and cut extruded the gap between the ears of the Knight.

                <h2>3D Modelling Assignment</h2>
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/3DAssignmentDesign.png" width=600px><br>
                To demonstrate that this design can only be made using 3D printing, I wanted to combine a mix of round shapes and flat shapes so I made a model of a person with a sphere for a head holding up a spherical shape with one arm. There are also bends and curves around the legs and left arm which cannot be seen from the front angle.

                <h3>Parameter Sketching</h3>
                <img src="images/LC5.png" width=600px><br>
                The above are my parameters for drawing out the sketches for my box.
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/LC4.png" width=600px><br>
                I extruded my sketches acording to the thickness of my parameters. After making all the separate bodies, I created a new sketch for each face to get the sketch of each face to save as a .dxf file for laser cutting.
                <h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
                <img src="images/LC1.jpg" width=600px><img src="images/LC2.jpg" width=600px><img src="images/LC3.jpg" width=600px><br>
                After cutting out all the parts above, I fitted them together. Initially, I only wanted to glue the lid together but I did not take into account kerf for the main body so I also had to glue them together.
