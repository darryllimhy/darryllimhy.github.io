                <h2>GIMP</h2>
                <img src="images/me.jpeg" width=300px>
                <img src="images/meGIMP.png" width=300px><br>
                I used the free transform tool in GIMP to trace the silhouette of me ,deleted the background of the original picture and inserted a background of a beach.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Inkscape</h2>
                <img src="images/shisa.jpg" width=300px><br>
                I opened the image using Inkscape and used the path tool to trace the outlines of the creature.
                <img src="images/inkscapeoutline.png" width=300px>
                <img src="images/inkscape.png" width=300px><br>
                After tracing, I used the fill tool to fill in the basic colours of the creature.

                <h2>Name Tag</h2><br>
                <h3>Sketch</h3>
                <img src="images/Tag1.png" width=600px><br>
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/Tag2.png" width=600px><br>
                After making the sketch (Create > Create Sketch), I used extrude (Create > Extrude) on the silhouette, the base of the name tag and on the text of my name.

                <h2>Lego</h2>
                <h3>Overhead View</h3>
                <img src="images/Lego1.png" width=600px><br>
                I sketched a rectanglular shape and used extrude to form a cuboid. I then sketched a circle on the surface of the top side of the cuboid, extruded it, used fillet (Modify > Fillet) to round out the edges and then used rectangular pattern (Create > Pattern > Rectangular Pattern) to repeat the modified circle.
                <h3>Bottom View</h3>
                <img src="images/Lego2.png" width=600px><br>
                I hollowed out the bottom of the cuboid with shell (Modify > Shell), sketched out two circles and extruded them to form a cylinder. After which, I also used the rectangular pattern to repeat the cylinders.

                <h2>Chess Piece - Knight</h2>
                <h3>Sketch</h3>
                <img src="images/Knight2.png" width=600px><br>
                I inserted a reference image found online using canvas (Insert > Canvas) and traced it, only making slight adjustments to the base of the chess piece. After tracing it, I was not satisfied with the size of the chess piece so I scaled (Modify > Scale) the outlines to my liking.
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/Knight1.png" width=600px><br>
                I used revolve on the base and extruded the body of the chess piece. I wanted to add more details to the body of the Knight so I made more sketches and used extrude. I extruded the mane of the Knight and cut extruded the gap between the ears of the Knight.

                <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                <h3>Parameter Sketching</h3>
                <img src="images/LC5.png" width=600px><br>
                The above are my parameters for drawing out the sketches for my box.
                <h3>3D Model</h3>
                <img src="images/LC4.png" width=600px><br>
                I extruded my sketches acording to the thickness of my parameters. After making all the separate bodies, I created a new sketch for each face to get the sketch of each face to save as a .dxf file for laser cutting.
                <h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
                <img src="images/LC1.jpg" width=600px><img src="images/LC2.jpg" width=600px><img src="images/LC3.jpg" width=600px><br>
                After cutting out all the parts above, I fitted them together. Initially, I only wanted to glue the lid together but I did not take into account kerf for the main body so I also had to glue them together.
