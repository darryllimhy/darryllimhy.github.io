                <h2>Concept Sketch</h2>
                <img src="images/Sketch.png" width=600px>
                <br>
                It being a Calculator I wanted it to be small enough such that it can be portable and be held easily. However. taking into account that the jumper wires take up quite a fair bit of space, I had to make it slightly bulkier.

                <h2>3D Model</h2>
                <img src="images/Calc3DModel.png" width=600px>
                <br>
                I measured the size of the Arduino and LCD and designed the 3D model similar to my concept sketch and to fit the Arduino and LCD screen.

                <h2>Cardboard Prototype</h2>
                <img src="images/Prototype.png" width=600px>
                <br>
                I wanted to make sure everything fits so I made a Cardboard prototype to see how my Arduino and LCD screen fits. After testing, I made some adjustments to my 3D model to give more room for wires in the calculator head.
                <br>
                <h2>Laser Cutting and 3D Printing</h2>

                <img src="images/Calculator3DPrint.png" width=300px>
                <br>
                I used the bodies from my 3D model to get the .dxf files to laser cut and make .stl for 3D printing slicing. I then glued all the components together aside from the top acrylic layer as I want the components to be accessible.

                <h2>Testing the Circuit</h2>
                <img src="images/Test.png" width = 600px>
                <br>
                Before I put everything together, I tested out my components to see if everything works.
                <br>
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <img src="images/Final.png" width = 600px>
                <br>
                You may notice that the numpad and LCD screen is upside down. The reason for that is that I did not take into account the horizontal length the I2C module at the back of the LCD takes up so I had to flip it. As a result, I had to flip everything else.
